## Co-working times (optional)

Co-working sessions are where we work at the same time together.
Sometimes, this means quiet work with check-ins to break up focused work
and get feedback, and sometimes this involves asking questions and
screensharing to learn and problem solve.

- **Dates:** Thursdays April 18, May 2, 16, 30
- **Times:** 11:00 - 12:00 PT / 1:00 - 3:00 pm ET
- **Location:** remotely, via Teams

## Participating teams

Some brief information about participating teams. Please add any edits
directly (we’ll learn how in our GitHub Clinic!). Take some inspiration from [NOAA Fisheries Champions teams](https://github.com/Openscapes/2021-noaa-nmfs/blob/main/README.md). 

You might add:

- What kind of team you are (cross-divisional) or where you are from (division focusing on...)
- Links to your program and what you are working on together
- Brief description of your potential projects
- Who is on your team

  the whole Champions program and we’ll ask that everyone participating
  reads it before our first Cohort Call on April 10.
